## Loop Follow

### Purpose:

Using so many different apps as a parent or caregiver of a T1D can be very cumbersome. Add in the extra details from Looping
and it can be a challenge flipping back and forth between apps. Each app has different strengths and weaknesses.
- Spike is great for alarms. 
- Spike and Sugarmate are great for the calendar complication on Apple Watch. 
- Nightscout X or Nightscout in Safari are needed for intricate details from NS.
- IFTTT and Pushover are  needed for Not Looping alerts.

And there are some functions I've always wished for and not found anywhere such a one-time temporary alert
for those nights when Loop is stuck on high and you open loop with a correction. This lets you set a higher
low alert for the BG you want to wake up to and close Loop.

### Building Options

Please see [Loop and Learn: Loop Follow](https://www.loopandlearn.org/loop-follow/) for all the building options.

### General feature list

Please review the list on [Loop and Learn: Loop Follow](https://www.loopandlearn.org/loop-follow/) which may be updated more frequently than this README.md file.

- scrollable/scalable graph display with BG, basal, bolus, and carb details plus Loop status, Loop Prediction, and the General NS Care portal info.
- Override DND and system volume for all alerts.
- snoozes per alert, presnooze, edit existing snooze, and snooze all alert settings.
- the standard Low/High, Urgent Low/High, and missed reading alerts with additonal option to select persistence; for example, alert when high for x minutes.
- fast drop/rise alerts with BG limits; for example, alert for fast drop only when glucose is below specific value.
- sage/cage reminder alerts for x hours before change.
- Not Looping with glucose limits alert: you can configure the alert if under or over a glucose range.
- Missed Bolus alert.
- calendar entries to use watch complication with BG, arrow, delta, cob, iob and minutes ago (if old reading).
- background silent audio to keep iOS from killing the app. This is why it canâ€™t go in the App Store for just a simple download.

### Open Source DIY
- This is a DIY open source project that may or may not function as you expect. You take full responsibility for building and running this app and do so at your own risk.
